# Patent_Analysis
 This project dives into the complex world of patent data, using SQL to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that are essential for understanding the innovation landscape. The dataset includes a wide range of attributes, from application dates and publication details to inventor and applicant information, providing a rich foundation for analysis.
Analysis Steps
The analysis is divided into the following key steps:
1.Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and removing duplicates.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, distribution analysis, and trend analysis.
3.Segment Analysis: Grouping patents by status, country, and classification.
4.Advanced Analysis: Priority claims analysis, inventor and applicant analysis, examination, and grant analysis.
5.Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships and predicting outcomes
